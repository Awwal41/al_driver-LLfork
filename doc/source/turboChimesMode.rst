  **Fig. 1:** The TurboChIMES fitting framework.


TurboChIMES framework is designed to account for both short and long-range interactions effectively using a low-complexity model. This offers two major advantages which include accounting for long-range physics more effectively at relatively low complexity and computational cost. This framework has been integrated into the Active learning driver to ensure a smooth design matrix development and simulation. The figure shows how this model accounts for both short and long-range interactions separately.

============================
Example Fit: Propane system
============================


.. Note ::

    Files for this example are located in ``./<al_driver base folder>/examples/simple_iter_single_statepoint-lmp-test-turbo-test``
    
In this section, an example 3-iteration fit for propane. The example allows us to look at the short-range effect within a propane molecule and the long-range Van der Waal effect between different propane molecules within the simulation box.


The necessary input files and directory tree structure are provided in the example folder, i.e.:

Compared with the ``ALC-0_BASEFILES`` folder provided in the:ref:`page-basic`, the primary difference is the ``LMPMD_BASEFILES`` and ``LMP_BASEFILES`` directory, i.e., which contains the files required to run the LAMMPs simulation and QM respectively. Other differences include the 0.fm_setup.in includes the hyperparameters and cut_offs  for the short-range interaction while the 1.fm_setup.in includes that for the long range.

Input Files 
------------------------------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ALC-0_BASEFILES Files 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Warning::

    The ``ALC-0_BASEFILES/fm_setup.in`` requires a few special edits for hierarchical learning mode:

    * ``fm_setup.in`` should have ``# HIERARC #`` set ``true``
    * All 1- through *n*\-body interactions described in in the reference (``HIERARCH_PARAM_FILES``) files must be explicitly excluded
    * Orders in the ``ALC-0_BASEFILES/fm_setup.in`` file should be greater or equal to those in the reference (``HIERARCH_PARAM_FILES``) files
    * ``TYPEIDX`` and ``PAIRIDX`` entries in the base fm_setup.in file must be consistent with respect to the ``HIERARCH_PARAM_FILES`` files
    * ``SPECIAL XB`` cutoffs must be set to ``SPECIFIC N``, where *N* is the number of **NON**-excluded *X*\B interaction types 
    
    For additional information on how to configure these options, see the ChIMES LSQ manual `(link <UPDATE LINK>)`_.

The primary difference between the present ``config.py`` and that provided in the  file :ref:`page-basic` documentation is the N_HYPER_SETS which has to be given a value of 2 this informs ALD that he needs to use the TurboChIMES fitting framework. It is important to note that to use the TurboChIMES framework the Molecular dynamics portion of the code has to be done using LAMMPS. This is because the code is going to be generating two pair types one for short range and the other for long range LAMMPS has been designed to handle multiple pair types using the hybrid overlay pair type. If N_HYPER_SETS is set to one then the Basic or Hierarch fitting approach would be done depending if the config file HIERARCH parameter as been set to true..
